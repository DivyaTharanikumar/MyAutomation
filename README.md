# MyAutomation

This is my first Automation Testing Project with the help of Selenium and Python.

I have used Page-Object Model to automate the following test cases for the website Amazon.com:

   				'when user goes to main page, page should be loaded'
 				   'In Main page, when user hits search "lenovo" button, he should see results for lenovo'
 				   'In Main page, when user clicks "Sign up" button, he should see Sign up Page'
 				   'In Main page, when user clicks "Sign in" button, he should see Sign in Page'
 				   'In Login Page, when user tries to login with a valid user id, he should see Home Page'
 				   'In Login Page, when user tries to login with a in-valid user id, he should see Error Message'
